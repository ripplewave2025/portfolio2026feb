Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
With Artificial Intelligence (AI), the possibilities are endless.
I use AI to understand and solve basically every problem — even to remind myself to think and use AI.
Sometimes it works unexpectedly well. Sometimes it doesn’t. But it keeps learning by itself.
That’s why — more than ever — Truth, Beauty, Curiosity, Humor and Culture have never mattered more.
My Journey
Lamahatta, Darjeeling (2009)
Born in the hills. I loved physics and computers (my first love). Realised early that communication is the real superpower.
As a kid, when I first saw a cellphone, I instantly knew one day we would watch TV on it. I also imagined working from home on a computer — and years later I actually spent five years doing exactly that. It made me shy and quiet.
Now I’m dreaming bigger: in my lifetime I will be able to teleport anywhere for work and return home in 15 minutes to see my parents.
Darjeeling Schools & College
Top student. Dropped college to focus on building real communication skills.
Real-World Grind (2009–2025)
Hospitality jobs, Dubai cashier, Kolkata manager, accounts at Uber, technical support at Dell.
Learned humility, precision, delegation and how to get things done with people (still learning).
June 2025 – The Turning Point
Resigned to go all-in on AI. No more distractions.
Present – What I’m Building Right Now
Hyper-Personalised AI Assistant
Remembers everything about you and gives guidance, advice, and keeps you on track.
Personal Tech Support AI
Specialized assistant for Windows-based devices that solves problems and makes computers easy for anyone (exactly what I used to do at Dell).
Websites & Experiments
Creating clean, useful websites for small businesses + AI education content + tools + chatbots for endangered languages like Sherpa and Bhutia.
My Mantra
T = Teleportation
C = Content creation
P = Podcast
I keep formulating the right questions. Once the question is right, the answer is often the easiest part.
Knowledge Compression Tools
Turning 8-hour complex topics into something you can understand in 1 hour or less — by cross-referencing what you already know and creating convergence points. Exploring AI + BCI possibilities.
Quantum + AI Systems
Combining classical AI with quantum computing to break the limits of distance (long-term optimistic research).

Future – Next 10 Years
2026–2028
Launch and grow aifrostudents.online — educational convergence of real-life skills and AI.
Continue developing the Hyper-Personalised AI Assistant as a multi-agent system that delegates tasks and keeps me focused.
2028–2032
Build a prototype device that teleports small physical objects — guided by human values.
Explore sustainable power sources (solar and beyond) — optimistic that AI will help discover new solutions.
2032–2036
Achieve the first Mars-to-Earth quantum link. Distance officially becomes history.
Core Belief
In the age of accelerating AI, nothing matters more than learning to communicate with clarity, seeking truth as rigorously as possible, staying deeply curious, and honestly documenting and preserving our cultures while truly understanding them.
Humans have been the most intelligent species on Earth for our entire history.
That chapter is closing faster than most people realise.
Anyone who has used modern AI has seen the rate of improvement firsthand. In just a few years, AI systems have passed difficult professional exams, reached gold-medal level in mathematics olympiads, outperformed expert coders, solved the 50-year protein-folding problem in biology (AlphaFold), and entered self-recursive learning loops that improve themselves.
Benchmarks across almost every field are being exhausted at an unprecedented pace.
The next frontier is even bigger: what happens when this intelligence integrates with robotics and the physical world?
That is exactly why I am building personal AI assistants from my home in Lamahatta, Darjeeling — systems that remember you deeply, stay aligned with human values, and can responsibly grow with whatever future arrives.
LET’S BUILD THE FUTURE TOGETHER
One Last Thing Before You Go – A Taste of AI
You’ve now walked through my entire journey — from the misty hills of Darjeeling to the dream of quantum teleportation.
Before you close this page, here’s the simplest way I understand AI:
AI is the world’s greatest mirror It has seen everything humanity ever created and reflects patterns back perfectly.
It’s prediction on steroids A super-intelligent parrot that finishes your sentences better than you can.
We are the ants We can use it and guide it — but we will probably never fully understand what it truly is.
That’s why human things matter more The faster AI grows, the more we need Truth, Beauty, Curiosity, Humor and Culture.
